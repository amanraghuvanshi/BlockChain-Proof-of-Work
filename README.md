# **Working with the chains of blocks - BLOCKCHAIN**

**This program is for creating a blockchain that could be further used when we are working with the payment and documentation channel to implement the technique of blockchain onto there**

<hr>

**The language was chosen as Go, as it is light and would give us an overhand advantage of concurrency**

<hr>

**The work is simple and clean. The blockchain has five major components**
* Data: The payload that is inside the block
* PrevHash: The hash value or the pointer to then prevBlock that will help in connecting this block to the previous block
* NextHash: The hash value or the pointer to next Block for connection
* TimeStamp: The timestamp on which the block was created
* Position: The position of the block in the chain
